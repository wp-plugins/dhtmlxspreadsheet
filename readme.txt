This plugin allows you to quickly create an Excel-like, editable spreadsheet with basic cell formatting and math functions support.


== Description ==

With dhtmlxSpreadsheet, you can quickly add a nice-looking, editable data table on your WordPress page. The plugin takes the content from the database table and displays it in an Excel-like spreadsheet with basic cell formatting, math functions, and keyboard navigation support. It offers an effective solution if you need to organize and share some data online in a table view.


The spreadsheet can be displayed in edit or read-only mode. All changes made in a table on a web page (add/edit/delete records) are automatically saved to the database. dhtmlxSpreadsheet provides built-in export to PDF and Excel, as well as clipboard support, allowing you to copy and paste data from Excel documents right into your browser-based table.
